# Simultaneous Estimation of Multi-state Multiple Systems Data

This repository contains the code and data files for executing the data analysis.

The data required for our data analysis is divided into two categories: (a) Roamer_data  (b) Seater_data. Each of these contains TRS datasets for 16 administrative regions of Ghana.

1.FSW_HIV Code_Jeffrey(Roamer): Data Analysis code under Prior I for Roamer FSW.
2.FSW_HIV Code_Binomial(Roamer): Data Analysis code under Prior II for Roamer FSW.
3.FSW_HIV Code_Jeffrey(Seater): Data Analysis code under Prior I for Seater FSW.
4.FSW_HIV Code_Binomial(Seater): Data Analysis code under Prior II for Seater FSW.

Each of these codes will reproduce required estimates, trace plots and significance plots.
